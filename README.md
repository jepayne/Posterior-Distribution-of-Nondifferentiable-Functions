# Posterior-Distribution-of-Nondifferentiable-Functions
This GitHub repository contains supplementary materials for the paper Kitagawa, T., Montiel-Olea, J. and Payne, J. "Posterior Distribution of Nondifferentiable functions". (2017)

Materials included:
- Figures folder contains code for generating Figures in the paper and the online appendix
- Appendix folder contains a copy of the online appendix

Instructions:
- All code has been written in matlab
- You can run the code by setting the appropriate Figures subdirectory as your current working directory in Matlab and then running the RunFile in the Figures subdirectory.

Comments:
- The parameter values have been reduced in the code so that it can run more quickly. If you want to match the exact figures from the paper, then you will need to increase the parameter values to the numbers described in the code annotation.
